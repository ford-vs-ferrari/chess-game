ChessGame: The is_game_over() method is not implemented. Senior devs need to implement checkmate detection logic.
Board: The move_piece() function lacks checks for valid pathing and specific rules for different piece types. It also lacks logic for checkmate and checks.
Player: The get_move() method is incomplete, missing the logic for user interaction (or input parsing for the move).
Piece: is_valid_move() and get_symbol() are placeholders, with no actual logic for any piece movement or representation.
Other Pieces: Additional piece classes like Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, and King are missing and should be implemented similarly to Pawn, but with their respective move logic.
